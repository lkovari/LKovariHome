TODO list:

Import StateKey and TransferState from @angular/core instead of @angular/platform-browser.
Use includeRequestsWithAuthHeaders: true in withHttpTransferCache to opt-out of caching for HTTP requests that require authorization.
Tests may run additional rounds of change detection to fully reflect test state in the DOM. As a last resort, revert to the old behavior by adding provideZoneChangeDetection({ignoreChangesOutsideZone: true}) to the TestBed providers.
Remove expressions that write to properties in templates that use [(ngModel)]
Move any environment providers that should be available to routed components from the component that defines the RouterOutlet to the providers of bootstrapApplication or the Route config.
Provide an absolute url instead of using useAbsoluteUrl and baseUrl from PlatformConfig.
Remove all imports of ServerTransferStateModule from your application. It is no longer needed.
For any components using OnPush change detection, ensure they are properly marked dirty to enable host binding updates.
